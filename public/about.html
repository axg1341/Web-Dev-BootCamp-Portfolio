<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>I find that I have an odd twist when it comes to software development. We all ultimately want to express ourselves in whatever means possible. I like to express myself in art and in code.</p>
<br>

<p>I think the ultimate means of expressing oneself is showing them your world. I find that XR and VR is the best way of showing someone that.</p>
